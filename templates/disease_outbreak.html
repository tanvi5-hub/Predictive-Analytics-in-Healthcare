<h3>Interpretation:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>The first graph shows trends in disease incidence and vaccination rates over time.</li>
    <li>The SARIMA forecast predicts future incidence rates based on historical data.</li>
    <li>The LSTM forecast provides an alternative prediction using deep learning techniques.</li>
    <li>The correlation heatmap displays the relationship between incidence and vaccination rates.</li>
    <li>The distribution of incidence rates helps identify typical ranges and outliers.</li>
    <li>The seasonal decomposition breaks down the time series into trend, seasonal, and residual components.</li>
</ul>
